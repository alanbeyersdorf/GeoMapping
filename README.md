# GeoMapping

# map1.py is the tutorial file I completed in the Udemy class
This is a python project is built off an example application from Ardit Sulce's Udemy Course "The Python Mega Course" 
@ https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

The original project charted the elevations of volcanoes over the western coast of the United States. 

I've since expanded on this project to include labels which include the elevations and volcanic types. 

# OWK_sampling_stations.py is my file in progress
For OWK_Sampling_stations.py, Old Woman Creek data sourced from: 
NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). System-wide Monitoring Program. Data accessed from the NOAA NERRS Centralized Data Management Office website: http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/; accessed 12 October 2012.

It is my first project using folium and pandas. 

note: I did not code any of the HTML files. They are products of folium. They update in conjuction with any updates to the python files.

The last functional change I made to this project was to add check boxes to toggle between active and inactive sampling stations.

This is likely the final version of this project. I plan to take what I've learned here to make another interactive map with new data.
