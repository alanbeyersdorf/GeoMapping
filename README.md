# GeoMapping

This is a python project is built off an example application from Ardit Sulce's Udemy Course "The Python Mega Course" 
@ https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

It is my first completed project using folium and pandas. 

Once I'm finished with Ardit's version, I plan to make a new branch to continue work on the application.
I hope to give the map my own visual style as well as add a few features, such as adding a pin from the HTML user interface.
