# GeoMapping

# map1.py is the tutorial file I completed in the Udemy class
# OWK_sampling_stations.py is my file in progress

This is a python project is built off an example application from Ardit Sulce's Udemy Course "The Python Mega Course" 
@ https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

For OWK_Sampling_stations.py, Old Woman Creek data sourced from: 
NOAA National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). System-wide Monitoring Program. Data accessed from the NOAA NERRS Centralized Data Management Office website: http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/; accessed 12 October 2012.

It is my first project using folium and pandas. 

note: I did not code any of the HTML files. They are products of folium. They update in conjuction with any updates to the python files.

Once I'm finished with Ardit's version, I plan to make a new branch to continue work on the application.
I hope to give the map my own visual style as well as add a few features, such as adding a pin from the HTML user interface.
